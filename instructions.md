Countdown Timer Setup Instructions

1. Clone the Repository
First, clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LaunchCountdown.git
cd LaunchCountdown

2. Structure Your Files
Ensure your project directory is structured as follows:

Project-Launch-Timer/
│
├── index.html        # Main HTML file
├── style.css         # CSS for styling
├── script.js         # JavaScript for countdown functionality
└── Img/
    └── MAIN-IMG.jpg  # Image file used in the countdown

3. Modify the Countdown Date
Open the script.js file and update the target date and time for your countdown:

let countdownDate = new Date("Aug 11, 2024 04:55:00").getTime();
Replace the date and time with your desired launch or event date.

4. Customize the Appearance
You can customize the look and feel of the countdown timer by editing the style.css file or the inline styles in index.html. Adjust colors, fonts, and layout to match your needs.

5. Add Your Image
Replace the existing image (MAIN-IMG.jpg) in the Img folder with your own image. Make sure the image path in the HTML file (index.html) is updated accordingly:

<img src="/Img/27517197.jpg" alt="Launch Image" id="image">

6. Deploy the Project
Once you're satisfied with your customization, you can deploy the project to GitHub Pages, Netlify, or any other hosting service to make it accessible online.

7. Run the Project Locally
To view the countdown timer locally, open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.

8. Additional Links
You can update or add your social media or project links by modifying the following section in index.html:


<div class="links">
    <ul>
        <a class="pip" href="https://www.instagram.com/yourprofile/" target="_blank">
            <li><i class="fa-brands fa-instagram "></i></li>
